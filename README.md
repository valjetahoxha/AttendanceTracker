# AttendanceTracker

The key components my team partner and I used are UI, ViewModel, Repository, Data Source(FireBase).
For UI States and Post Card Design, we used lambda functions such as onRemoveItem, onUpdateGuests to handle the updates of the guest list and the Card function as the root container for the post. 

Our project specifications were such that only the creator will have admin permission to check guests as present. On the main screen, we will display the map of the location " name, date, location and map".
